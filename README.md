All-PDF-Convertors using HTML CSS and JavaScript

Think of file formats as different languages. Programs can understand files that are in the language that they speak, but not files in other languages. If you try to open a PDF in Word, for example, it simply won't workâ€”if you get any data at all, it will resemble garbled text. A PDF converter works as a translator, taking the information contained in a PDF and making it understandable to another program by digitally transforming the contents into another form.

The mechanics of this conversion can be complex and will differ from format to format, but it all takes place behind the scenes. To support business use, with the swiftness of modern computers, most conversions are exceptionally fast.
